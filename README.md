# üìß Spam Classifier - Machine Learning Project

A Machine Learning project that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Natural Language Processing and a supervised ML algorithm. The final model is deployed as a **website** using Python (built in PyCharm).

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
- Removed unwanted columns, null values, and duplicates.
- Converted labels (`ham`, `spam`) to binary format.
- Preprocessed text: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized word frequency in spam vs non-spam messages.
- Compared message lengths, word clouds.
- Analyzed data balance (ham vs spam).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Vectorized text using **TF-IDF**.
- Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier.
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment
- Saved the model using `pickle`.
- Built a **web interface** to input messages and show predictions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Website (Built in PyCharm)
- Created an interactive website using **Streamlit** or **Flask**.
- User can enter a message and see if it's classified as Spam or Not Spam.
- All development and deployment handled in **PyCharm** IDE.
